# Viable Cannibalism

## Latest Version: 1.0.0 (Released 24.09.2020)

Viable Cannibalism is a mod that gives you the ability to convert others to cannibalism, making Ritual Cannibalism tenet somewhat useful and giving you that sweet 30 opinion bonus with every other cannibal.

At this moment in time, it will work just like witchcraft without the house modifier and the ability to host grand rite (which is implemented, but needs a mod to work). In the future, I am planning to add house modifier, cannibal feast events and the ability to gain your poor dinner's powers, maybe even immortality...

As this is my first time developing mods, I ask you to report all the bugs that you might encounter so I can fix them ASAP. Also I would love to get some help with changing events descriptions, because ATM they are almost identical to witchcraft ones.

## Features

- Added scheme that let's you convert anyone older than 16 and of your religion (will change) to cannibalism.
- Events corresponding to successful conversion or failure.
- AI will convert other's itself, making cannibalism more common.
