[h1]Viable Cannibalism[/h1]

Latest Version: 1.0.1 (Released 25.09.2020)

[b]Viable Cannibalism is a mod that gives you the ability to convert others to cannibalism, making Ritual Cannibalism tenet somewhat useful and giving you that sweet 30 opinion bonus with every other cannibal.[/b]

At this moment in time, it will work just like witchcraft without the house modifier and the ability to host grand rite (which is implemented, but needs a mod to work). In the future, I am planning to add house modifier, cannibal feast events and the ability to gain your poor dinner's powers, maybe even immortality...

As this is my first time developing mods, I ask you to report all the bugs that you might encounter so I can fix them ASAP. Also I would love to get some help with changing events descriptions, because ATM they are almost identical to witchcraft ones.

[b]Features
[list]
[*]Added scheme that let's you convert anyone older than 16 and of your religion (will change) to cannibalism.
[*]Events corresponding to successful conversion or failure.
[*]AI will convert other's itself, making cannibalism more common.
[/list]
