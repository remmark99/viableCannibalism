[h1]Viable Cannibalism[/h1]

Latest Version: 1.0.5 (Released 27.09.2020)

[b]Viable Cannibalism is a mod that gives you the ability to convert others to cannibalism, making Ritual Cannibalism tenet somewhat useful and giving you that sweet 30 opinion bonus with every other cannibal. For those who wish to become cannibal, there is a decision that let's you do this, and for those who already possess the power, there is an ability to devour your foes and get their powers! [/b]

At this moment in time, it will work just like witchcraft without it's own minor decision. In the future, I am planning to add house modifier, cannibal feast decision and more cannibal events in general.

As this is my first time developing mods, I ask you to report all the bugs that you might encounter so I can fix them ASAP. Also I would love to get some help with changing events descriptions, because ATM they are almost identical to witchcraft ones.

[b]Features[/b]

[/list]

*[spoiler]This has a 50% chance to do nothing, 40% chance to gain some illness and 10% to gain your victim's traits. Heads of faith of different religions have a 100% chance to give you their traits. Every trait except beauty traits can be gained. You get ALL the traits that your victim had and you didn't, but some traits can't be gained if you have their opposite version (e.g. deceitful - honest)[/spoiler]
